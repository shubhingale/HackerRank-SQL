You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, 
and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the 
result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

Input Format

The following tables contain contest data:

Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.

+-------------+----------+
| Field       | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| hacker_id   | integer  |
| Name        | string   |
+-------------+----------+
Submissions: The submission_id is the id of the submission, hacker_id is the id of the hacker who made the submission, challenge_id 
is the id of the challenge for which the submission belongs to, and score is the score of the submission.
+---------------+----------+
| Field         | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| submission_id | integer  |
| hacker_id     | integer  |
| challenge_id  | integer  |
| score         | integer  |
+-------------+----------+

Solution:

SELECT H.HACKER_ID,H.NAME, SUM(SCORE) AS TOTAL_SCORE
FROM HACKERS H INNER JOIN (SELECT HACKER_ID, CHALLENGE_ID, MAX(SCORE) AS SCORE FROM SUBMISSIONS GROUP BY HACKER_ID,CHALLENGE_ID) AS S 
ON H.HACKER_ID = S.HACKER_ID 
GROUP BY H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME
HAVING TOTAL_SCORE > 0
ORDER BY TOTAL_SCORE DESC, H.HACKER_ID ASC
