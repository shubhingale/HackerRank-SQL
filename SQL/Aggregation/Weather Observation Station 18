Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:
+-------------+-------------+
| Field       | Type        |
+-------------+-------------+
| ID          | NUMBER      |
| CITY        | VARCHAR(21) |
| STATE       | VARCHAR(2)  |
| LAT_N       | NUMBER      |
| LONG_W      | NUMBER      |
+-------------+-------------+
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

SOLUTION 1:

SELECT ROUND(ABS(MAX(LAT_N)- MIN(LAT_N)) + ABS(MAX(LONG_W)- MIN(LONG_W))),4) FROM STATION

SOLUTION 2:

WITH POINTS AS (SELECT ROUND(MIN(LAT_N),4) AS P1_A, ROUND(MIN(LONG_W),4) AS P1_B, ROUND(MAX(LAT_N),4) AS P2_A, ROUND(MAX(LONG_W),4) AS P2_B FROM STATION)

SELECT ABS(P1_A - P2_A) + ABS(P1_B - P2_B) FROM POINTS;
