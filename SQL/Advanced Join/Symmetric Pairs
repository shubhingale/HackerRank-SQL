You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.
+-------------+----------+
| Field       | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| X           | Integer  |
| Y           | Integer  |
+-------------+----------+

Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

Sample Input

+-------------+----------+
| ID          | Name     |
+-------------+----------+
| 20          | 20       |
| 20          | 20       |
| 20          | 21       |
| 23          | 22       |
| 22          | 23       |
| 21          | 20       |
+-------------+----------+

Sample Output

20 20
20 21
22 23

Solution:

SELECT f1.X, f1.Y FROM Functions AS f1 
WHERE f1.X = f1.Y AND
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Functions WHERE X = f1.X AND Y = f1.Y) > 1
UNION
SELECT f1.X, f1.Y from Functions AS f1
WHERE EXISTS(SELECT X, Y FROM Functions WHERE f1.X = Y AND f1.Y = X AND f1.X < X)
ORDER BY X;
